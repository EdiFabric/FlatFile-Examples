# EdiFabric Examples for Flat and CSV Files

Go to https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000280532-Trial-EdiFabric-Examples for the web version of this README.  

## 1. Overview
EdiFabric is a software development kit for .NET Framework and .NET Core, which makes it straightforward to parse, generate, validate, acknowledge, split, customize, or in other words, to programmatically manipulate EDI files. It is written in C# and is distributed as a set of NuGet packages and C# files.  

It currently supports all message types for the X12 and EDIFACT EDI standards, the German automotive standard VDA, as well as custom formatted flat files (delimited, positional, or a mixture of both).  

> NOTE: EdiFabric does not provide any communication components (AS2 or SFTP, for example), has no dashboard or UI, and is not a full end-to-end EDI solution.
The best option to get the gist of what EdiFabric is, and can do, is to play around with the trial and examples.  

The examples are organized into different projects in two logical categories: by product feature and by message type.    

## 2. Requirements
- Visual Studio, compatible with the supported .NET versions.  
- .NET Framework 4.5 or .NET Core 3.1. All projects target .NET Framework 4.5, however, the Target Framework from each project's properties can be changed to .NET Core 3.1.  
- EdiFabric trial NuGet packages and serial number.  

## 3. Download
The trial NuGet packages and the trial serial number can be downloaded from [here](https://sowl.co/oApEt).  

## 4. Install
Unzip the downloaded file in the previous step. The following folders should be available at the same level:  

edifabric-examples-edifact  
edifabric-examples-flatfile  
edifabric-examples-vda  
edifabric-examples-x12  
edifabric-trial  

Ensure that the following packages are present in folder edifabric-trial:  

EdiFabric.Core.9.8.7.5.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Framework.9.8.7.5.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Plugins.Ack.Edifact.9.8.7.5.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Plugins.Ack.X12.9.8.7.5.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Templates.Edifact.2.0.0.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Templates.Hipaa.2.0.0.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Templates.Padis.2.0.0.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Templates.Vda.2.0.0.nupkg  
EdiFabric.Templates.X12.2.0.0.nupkg  

## 5. Setup
Add folder edifabric-trial as a package source in Visual Studio:  
- From the top menu in Visual Studio go to *Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings -> Package Sources*  
- Add a new package source (by clicking the green plus button), then name it "EdiFabric Trial" and browse to select the edifabric-trial folder as the Source.  
- Click the Update button to apply the changes and then click OK to close the dialog.  

Rebuild the solution to install the rest of the dependencies. If there are any build errors, contact us at https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for assistance.  

> NOTE: it is possible to also reference DLLs instead of NuGet packages. Change the .nupkg extension of the packages to .zip, unzip them, and extract the DLL files. 
Then uninstall the NuGet packages from each project and replace them with DLL references.  

## 6. Serial Number
All main operations, like read, write, and validate require a valid serial number. The serial number is included in the file serial.key in folder edifabric-trial. Ensure it is there and that the file is not empty.  
The serial number is used in the file License.cs in project EdiFabric.Examples.FlatFile.Common. Open the file and ensure that the serialKeyPath is correct.
If the serial number is invalid or the file is missing, contact us at https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for assistance.  

## 7. Gettings started
To get started, set project EdiFabric.Examples.FlatFile.Read as the startup project, open ReadCSVFile.cs and run it.  

## 8. Examples by feature
Explore the different features of EdiFabric, such as translating from flat file file (Read) and generating flat file file (Write).  

## 9. Trial use
The trial assemblies are valid for 14 days and are subject to EdiFabric's license terms available at https://www.edifabric.com/files/eula.pdf. Upon expiry, the trial packages will begin throwing exceptions.   
To continue using the trial and the examples, you'll need to either request a trial extension or replace the trial packages, together with all references to the trial packages, with the full version of EdiFabric.   

## 10. Warranty
*The source code in these example projects is strictly for demonstrational purposes and is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, whether expressed or implied, including but not limited to the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.*
